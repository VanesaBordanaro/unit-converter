### The challenge

Users should be able to:

## My process
I started off with studying the figma prototype made for this project (https://www.figma.com/file/AdqUVRQCZGP1zRcEvzmJTm/Unit-Conversion?node-id=0%3A1) then the HTML
structure grouping elements with divs for flexbox to apply after for layout and styling with css. Finally I moved to javascript connecting the input value from the user for conversion.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Javascript
